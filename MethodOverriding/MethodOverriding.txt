Overriding is a feature that allows a child class to provide an specific implementation of a method that is already provided in parent class.

#Rules of method overriding:
1. Private methods of super class can not be overridden.
2. Protected methods can be made as public but not private in override.
3. Final methods cannot be overridden.
4. Static methods cannot be overridden.
5. The overriding method must have the same return type.
6. super keyword is used to invoke overridden method.
7. We cannot override the constructor.
